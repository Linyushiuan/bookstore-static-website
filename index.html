                                        Every family has a story. For some of us, our family of origin is a solid 
                                        foundation that feeds our confidence and helps us navigate life’s challenges. 
                                        For others, it’s a source of pain, hurt, and conflict that can feel like a lifelong 
                                        burden. In this empowering guide, licensed therapist and bestselling relationship
                                         expert Nedra Glover Tawwab offers clear advice for identifying dysfunctional 
                                         family patterns and choosing the best path to breaking the cycle and moving forward.
